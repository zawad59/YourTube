1st of all you need to install XAMPP Server with at least Apache and MySQL. Then download the Yourtube folder in this repository
to the htdocs folder of your installed XAMPP directory.

Now, there are a few dependencies to be sorted. First, go to your installed XAMPP directory and open "xampp-control.exe". Now you can start
Apache and Mysql from here. When you start these, take a note of the Port number at which Apache is running. You might need it later on.
Also, MySQL may not get started from XAMPP Server because of already running MySQL on your machine on the same port. If this case arises,
go to RUN from Windows and open "services.msc". From here you can turn off already-running MySQL and then you can start MySQL from Xampp easily.

For my PC, I have easily navigated to localhost/Yourtube/homepage.php after starting Apache and MySQL from Xampp. But similar case might not
happen for you because local host listening on a different port. In that case look at the port number at which Apache is running and navigate
to 127.0.0.1:"portnumber"/Yourtube/homepage.php (Assuming you have downloaded YourTube folder inside the htdocs folder of your Xamp installed directory).
At this time, you should see the homepage of Yourtube. But embedded videos might not load because of database credentials.

One important thing to do for loading full homepage is importing my database. In my Yourtube folder you will find a folder named "db'. Open it
to find my database "yourtube_embed.sql". Now from your browser navigate to 127.0.0.1:"portnumber"/phpmyadmin OR localhost/phpmyadmin (whichever works).
If phpmyadmin is opened create a new database with the exact same name as mine ("yourtube_embed"). Then you can import tables from my database to your created database.

Now from your browser navigate to 127.0.0.1:portnumber/phpmyadmin OR localhost/phpmyadmin. Load phpmyadmin home and you will see different tabs at the top like Databases,
SQL etc. You will fine User Accounts; click on this tab to expand it and you will see a list of distinct users with username and servernames.
Find the username "root" with server name "localhost" and click on Edit Privileges. Here, you will see an option of changing password at the top.
Expand it. Notice here that this new password is the password I have used to create my tables and perform all SQL operations. So your password must
match with mine in order to load my database and perform operations. 

So, the new password you must use for user root at localhost is "adios". Change it and confirm it.

Database credentials are still not completed. Go to your installed Xampp directory and find the folder named phpmyadmin. Here, you will find
a file named "config.inc.php". Open it in notepad and line numbers in the range 19-24, you will find database access credentials for localhost.
Change these following three lines like these:
1. $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] = 'root';
2. $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'adios';
3. $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = false;

Save this file and refresh your phpmyadmin page. Now navigate to 127.0.0.1:portnumber/Yourtube/homepage.php OR localhost/Yourtube/homepage.php (whatever works)
and the whole website with database access and operations will be ready to use.

One last thing: for admin, credentials are needed as password is saved after encryption. Credentials for system admin:
name:zawad
password:access
